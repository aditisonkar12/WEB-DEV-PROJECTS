      <strong>Salsa</strong> is a Latin dance, associated with the music genre
      of the same name, which was first popularized in the United States in the
      1960s in New York City. Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances, such as
      mambo, pachanga and rumba, as well as American dances such as swing and
      tap.
